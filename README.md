## Installation

> [!TIP]
> The easiest way to run the bot is using **Docker Compose**, as it automatically sets up all required dependencies (like Redis) for you. See the [Docker deployment guide](#docker) below.
> If you prefer a manual installation, follow the steps below.

- [Create a discord bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) and [add it to your server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#creating-and-using-your-invite-link) with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scope
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v18.0 or newer
- Install and run **[Redis](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/)** (the bot requires a Redis server to run)
- Clone/[Download](https://github.com/mistralwz/Ministral/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repo, rename the `config.json.example` file to `config.json` and put your bot token into it.
- [Open a command prompt in the same folder](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-from-right-click-menu#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20command%20prompt%20window%20in%20any%20folder%2C%20simply,the%20same%20inside%20any%20folder.) and type `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run [SkinPeek.js](https://github.com/mistralwz/Ministral/blob/master/SkinPeek.js) using `node SkinPeek.js` in the command prompt
- And that's it! Don't forget too give the bot a [role](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ) that allows it to send messages and embed links.
- Also note that you need to keep the window open for the bot to stay online. If you want it to run 24/7, consider using a [VPS](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/wiki/SkinPeek-Admin-Guide#which-vps-should-i-use).

## Useful Information

- [Can I get banned for using Ministral/SkinPeek?](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/wiki/Can-I-get-banned-for-using-SkinPeek%3F) (spoiler: nope, it's safe to use!)

- After installing, the bot should automatically deploy the slash commands globally. If they don't appear:
  - If you're getting `DiscordAPIError: Missing Access`, you probably forgot to add the `applications.commands` scope in step 1
  - Discord global commands can take up to 1h to update due to caching. If you don't want to wait, send `@bot !deploy guild` in a text channel the bot can see (`@bot` being you @mentionning your bot). This will deploy the commands immediately in that guild.
  - If you see every command twice, just send `@bot !undeploy guild`!

- The bot doesn't store your username/password. Instead, it uses a secure web-based login flow using the `/login` command to authenticate with Riot servers.
  - Your access and refresh tokens are stored locally on your hard drive, and are never shared with third parties.
  - You can easily delete your account from the bot's database anytime using the `/forget` command.  

- Once you're more or less familiar with how the bot works, you should read the [Admin Guide](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/wiki/SkinPeek-Admin-Guide) for advanced usage and tips & tricks for hosting the bot.

- If you're bored, check out [this writeup](https://gist.github.com/giorgi-o/e0fc2f6160a5fd43f05be8567ad6fdd7) on how Riot treats third-party projects like this one.

### Docker

<details open>
<summary>For users who want the easiest installation experience using Docker</summary>

Using Docker automatically spins up both the bot and its required Redis dependency, making it the easiest way to host the bot.

- [Create a discord bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) and [add it to your server](https://discordjs.guide/legacy/preparations/adding-your-app) with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scope
- Download or clone the repository to get the `docker-compose.yml` and `config.json.example` files.
- Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`.
- Put your bot token in [config.json](https://github.com/mistralwz/Ministral/blob/master/config.json.example) and make sure `"redisHost": "redis"` is set.
- Use `docker compose up -d` to start the bot, `docker compose logs -f` to see the logs and `docker compose down` to stop it.

## Translations

If you are fluent in another language and would like help translate the bot, either to a new language or to improve an existing translation, please do!

1. Look up the language code for your language [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales) or [here](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).
2. Look in this repo's `languages` folder.
3. If your language is already there, feel free to improve and modify it as much as you can!
4. Otherwise if you're starting from scratch, copy the `en-GB.json` and rename it to your language code.

Once you're done translating, you can either [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [open a GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), or you can just send me the JSON on Discord `mistralwz` and I'll upload it for you (with credit, of course).

Thank you! ❤️
